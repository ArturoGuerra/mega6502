# Introduction

This project is about experimenting with a hardcore 6502 processor. Concretely, I'm using a WDC w65c02s8, bought from Ali Express. It was made in 1999... so it's 21 years old, but it seems working.

The processor is driven by an Arduino Mega, which provides:
- a clock signal
- a ROM
- a RAM

The ROM is embedded into the Arduino sketch, as `rom.h` file. It is made by assembling the source code using CC65 suite and converted to a C array using xxd.

The Arduino Mega also serves as a logic analyser, and dumps the Address bus, Data bus, and some control signals (RWB, SYNC) to its serial port.

In addition, a program is provided to further analyse the serial transmission on the computer attached to the Arduino Mega. At the moment, this disassembles the running instructions.

# Pin Mappings

This diagrams shows the pin mapping between the Arduino Mega pins and the 6502 pins.

# Disassembling on the fly

The [disassemble/serialHost.py](disassemble/serialHost.py) Python scripts reads the serial output from the Arduino Mega, and tries to disassemble it on the fly.

It will build the instructions byte per byte, as they are coming.

## Example of `serialHost.py` output

The program being run in this example is the following loop:

```
LF000:  lda     $2000                           ; F000 AD 00 20
        sta     $2000                           ; F003 8D 00 20
        jmp     LF000                           ; F006 4C 00 F0

```

At the time of running this:
- when the 6502 is reading from $2000, the Mega will send the byte value of Pin Port F (Register PINF)
- when writing to $2000, the Mega will write to Pin Port K (Register PORTK)

So the program is continuously copying PINF into PORTK of the Arduino Mega, in other works, it's reading the logic level of the 8 pins of port F, and setting the logic level of the 8 pins of port K to be the same.

Let's see the output of `serialHost.py` in this case. The first column (before the `|` is the output from Arduino Mega). After the `|` is the decoding.

F008 F0 r 0 | f006  4C 00 F0     jmp $F000        ABS  
```

Notice how bytes are replaced by ".." when the instruction is incomplete, and they are filling in progressively to decode the complete instruction.
